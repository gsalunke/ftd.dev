-- ft.h0: Built-in Types

`ftd` comes with some built-in types. These types can be used to construct more
complex types like [`record`](/record/) and
[`or-type`](/or-type/).

-- ft.h1: `boolean`

This type is used to represent boolean values `true` and `false`.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- boolean is-monday: true

-- ft.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring a boolean variable.

-- ft.h1: `integer`

This is integer type, can be positive or negative.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- integer number-of-days-in-a-week: 7

-- ft.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring an integer variable.

-- ft.h1: `decimal`

This type is used to represent decimal numbers.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- decimal pi: 3.14159

-- ft.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring a decimal variable.

-- ft.h1: `string`

This is unicode string.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

`caption` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be used when
declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `caption`,
it can be passed in the "caption" location in `ftd::p1` "section".

-- ft.code: record with caption
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
name: caption

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma

-- ft.markdown:

If something is specified as `caption`, it can come in the "caption" location, eg
in case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in the declaration
of `shobhit` variable.

-- ft.h1: `body`

`body` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be used when
declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.
