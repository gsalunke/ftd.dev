-- import: ft
-- import: config

\-- ft-core.concept:


-- ft.doc-page:
toc: $ft.toc


-- ftd.column:
id: foo


-- ft.h0: `component`

A `component` in `ftd` is similar to "react component", `components` have 
"arguments", this the data that must be passed to them, and using `component`s we 
construct the user interface.


-- ft.h1: Creating A Component

New components are defined using the `component` keyword:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text heading:
$title: caption
text: ref $title
size: 35
color: red


-- ft.markdown:

Here we have defined a new component `heading`.


-- ft.h2: Parent Component

Every component inherits from a "parent component". This is provided by the 
[header](p1-grammar/) `component`.

In this case, our `heading` component is using `ftd.text`. We are creating a
custom-component with shows given text with the font size of 18 pixels.


-- ft.h3: Kernel Components

So how is `ftd.text` implemented? `ftd` comes with some "kernel components", these are the lowest
level components that every other component uses directly or indirectly.

Read about our [kernel components guide](kernel/) to learn about 
these components.


-- ft.h2: Component Arguments

Component "arguments" starts with `$`, in our component we have one such argument,
`$title`. 

The type of our `$title` argument is `caption`. You can read more about `caption` 
in the [`ftd` types guide](built-in-types/).


-- ft.h3: Arguments with Default Values

An argument can be defined with a default value:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text foo:
$name: caption
$size: integer with default 10
text: ref $name

\-- foo: hello (uses default value of $size)

\-- foo: this is nice
size: 20


-- ft.markdown:

Since `foo` defines `$size` with a default value, it is used in the first instance,
and in second we overwrite the default value.


-- ft.h2: Component Local Variables

FTD components can define local variables. These variables are automatically 
created for each component, and is mainly for handling events.

Component "local variables" starts with `@`:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text foo:
$name: caption
@open: boolean with default true
text: ref $name
if: @open
$event-click$: toggle @open


-- ft.markdown:

This will create a `@open`. We are using `if` to only show the component if `@open`
is `true`, which will be the case by default as we have added `with default true`
clause to `@open` declaration. 

We have also set `click` event handler to `toggle @open`, so the effect would be
if someone clicks on the message it will go away.

We can also refer to global variables or component arguments (eg `$name` here) as
the default value of a local variable.


-- ft.h2: Using Container Components

Some components have children. `ftd` comes with two kernel container components,
[`ftd.row`](row/) and [`ftd.column`](column/).


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.row label:
$name: caption
$value: body
spacing: 5

\--- ftd.text:
style: bold
text: ref $name

\--- ftd.text:
width: fill
text: ref $value


-- ft.markdown:

Here we are trying to create a "label component", which has two arguments, `$name`
and `$value`.

The `label` component uses an `ftd.row` and has two `ftd.text` children. `ftd.row`
shows its children in a single row.

Note that we have used `--- ` to indicate that the two `ftd.text` are 
sub-sections of the `ftd.row` section (review [ftd.p1 
grammar](p1-grammar/)).

We have passed the component arguments to each `ftd.text`.

A container component can use other container components and create an heirarchy
of such components, read more about it in "[container management 
guide](container/)".


-- ft.h1: Using Components

Say we want to use our heading and label components:


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.column:
spacing: 20
border-width: 1
border-radius: 5
padding: 10

\-- heading: hello there! This is my heading

\-- label: Name
value: Amit Upadhyay

\-- label: Location
value: Banglore, India

\-- container: ftd.main


-- ft.markdown:

Here we have created one heading and two labels. 

We have placed the `heading` and `label`s inside an `ftd.column` to put some 
spacing between them. 

We have also used the `container` keyword, part of the `ftd container management` 
facility, to reset the current container to `ftd.main` so the rest of this document
is not made part of the `ftd.column`.

This is how it looks like:


-- ftd.text heading:
$title: caption
text: ref $title
size: 35
color: red


-- ftd.row label: 
width: fill
caption name:
body value:
spacing: 5

--- ftd.text:
style: bold
text: ref $name

--- ftd.text:
width: fill
text: ref $value


-- ftd.column:
spacing: 20
border-width: 1
border-radius: 5
padding: 10


-- heading: hello there! This is my heading


-- label: Name
value: Amit Upadhyay


-- label: Location
value: Banglore, India


-- container: foo


-- ft.h2: Container Management

Every `ftd` document is rendered with a top-level container initialized. This
top-level container is an [`ftd.column`](column/), it places its 
children on top of each other.

`ftd` also has a concept of `current container`. When the document starts, the top
level container is set as the current container. 

When a "container component" is initialized, with no children specified as 
sub-sections, it becomes the current container, and all future components are 
placed in it.

We can set the current container to any container using that container's `id` 
property. The default top-level container can be set using `ftd.main` alias.

Read more about it in the [container management guide](/container/).


-- ft.h1: Conditional Components

`ftd` supports a `if` to decide if the component should be visible or not, based
on the arguments, or global variables.


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- var dark-mode: true

\-- ftd.text: we are in dark mode
if: dark-mode

\-- ftd.text: light mode rules
if: not dark-mode


-- ft.markdown:

We have inserted two `ftd.text` components, but only one of them would be visible,
based on the value of the `dark-mode` variable.

Read more about it in [conditional components guide](if/).
